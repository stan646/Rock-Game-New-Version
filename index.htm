                Guidelines for Playing Rock, Scissors, Paper
                <br><br>
                Rock, Scissors, Paper is a simple and fun hand game often used to make decisions or just for
                entertainment.
                Follow these guidelines to understand how to play:
                Objective of the Game
                The goal is to choose a hand gesture (Rock, Scissors, or Paper) that defeats your opponent's
                gesture
                according to the rules.<br><br>
                How to Play
                <br><br>
                1. Players:
                 The game is played between You and Computer.
                 <br><br>
                2. Preparation:
                 - Each player makes a fist with one hand.
                 - The game begins with both players click, "Rock, scissors, paper, shoot!" or a similar
                countdown.
                <br><br>
                3. Gestures:
                 On "shoot," each player simultaneously shows one of three gestures with their hand:
                 - Rock: A closed fist.
                 - Scissors: Two fingers extended, mimicking the shape of scissors.
                 - Paper: An open hand with fingers extended
                 <br><br>
            4. Winning Rules:
            The outcome is determined as follows:
            - Rock crushes Scissors: Rock wins.
            - Scissors cut Paper: Scissors win.
            - Paper covers Rock: Paper wins.
            - Same Gesture: It's a tie; play again.
            <br><br>
                Example Scenarios
                - Player 1 shows Rock, Player 2 shows Scissors -> Player 1 wins (Rock crushes Scissors).
                - Player 1 shows Scissors, Player 2 shows Paper -> Player 1 wins (Scissors cut Paper).
                - Player 1 shows Paper, Player 2 shows Paper -> Tie, replay the round.<br><br>
                Tips for Fun Play
                <br><br>
                - Be quick with your gesture to keep the game exciting.
                - Add a best-of-three or best-of-five format to determine the overall winner.
                - Use the game to decide small disagreements or just for a quick, friendly competition!
                Now you're ready to play!
